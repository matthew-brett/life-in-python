# A short personal history

* Pre-clinical medicine, and psychology
* Clinical medicine
* Neurology
* PhD (time) in Positron Emission Tomography

# My world in 1996-9

* SPM - in Matlab
* A lab full of doctors
* My first teaching
* My first toolbox

# Another world 1999-2003

* Cambridge research unit
* A lab full of scientists
* Very little experience of imaging
* The Kanwisher bomb via Russell Epstein
* Marsbar (version control, Sourceforge)

# Another world 2003-2005

* Berkeley psychology department
* University full of scientists
* FMRI still young
* Neuroimaging back then; SPM, AFNI, FSL
* Meeting Jarrod
* Starting with Python

# The world starts to change 2004-5

* The grant idea
* The grant meetings
* Fernando Perez, John Hunter, Travis Oliphant, Jonathan Taylor
* Python back then

# Adrift back home

* Cambridge research unit again
* A world of Matlab and "research support".
* Nipy starts
* Dipy starts
* Scipy continues
* Fernando comes to Berkeley

# Back in the new world 2008-2017

* Numpy, scipy, Matplotlib
* Nibabel
* Nipy falls to pieces
* The IPython notebook, and Jupyter
* The Python wave, Pandas, Statmodels.
* The data science wave.

# Looking back

* [Who's
  building?](https://asterisk.dynevor.org/who-is-building-the-foundations.html)
* [How are things
  built?](https://asterisk.dynevor.org/how-do-the-foundations-get-built.html)

# Where we're headed

* The world of the programmers toolbox
* Code as basis for teaching
* Your name here

# A summary

* "Lento pero asplastante"
* Absurd ambition
* Find your team
* Anyone can play

# What's your goal?
